= Implementation of the CloudEvents Specification 

Simple CDI libray for the link:https://github.com/cloudevents/spec[CloudEvents Specification]

== JAX-RS support

Adding the libary to your JAX-RS based application integrates its `/ce` endpoint for handling CloudEvents.

Receiving different multi-cloud events, using the CDI API:

[source,java]
----
public class Monitor {

    public void receiveCloudEventFromAWS(@Observes @EventType(name = "aws.s3.object.created") CloudEvent<?> cloudEvent) {

        System.out.println("S3 event: " + cloudEvent);

    }
    public void receiveCloudEventFromAzure(@Observes @EventType(name = "Microsoft.Storage.BlobCreated") CloudEvent<?> cloudEvent) {

        System.out.println("Azure event: " + cloudEvent);

    }
}
----

== Java SE / Weld-SE support

Vanilla CDI support and APIs for CloudEvents

=== Creating and firing an event:

[source,java]
----
public class EventPublisher {

    @Inject
    private Event<CloudEvent<MyCustomEvent>> cloudEvent;

    public void doAndTrigger() throws Exception {

        // do some domain specific stuff...

        CloudEvent<MyCustomEvent> event = new CloudEventBuilder<MyCustomEvent>()
                .eventType("Cloud.Storage.Item.Created")
                .source(new URI("/trigger"))
                .eventID(UUID.randomUUID().toString())
                .build();

        cloudEvent.select(
                    new EventTypeQualifier("Cloud.Storage.Item.Created"))
                .fire(event);

    }
}
----

=== Receiving the event

[source,java]
----
...
    public void receiveCloudEvent(@Observes @EventType(name = "Cloud.Storage.Item.Created") CloudEvent cloudEvent) {

        receiver.ack();
    }
----
